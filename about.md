<p clear="right">
I am an University student in Japan, especially interested in system programming and security research.  

I am primarily focused on kernel, hypervisor, exploitation and something like that.

# Main projects
- [Reverse Debugger for radare2](https://radare.gitbooks.io/radare2book/content/debugger/revdebug.html)  
You can now seek program counter back and forth by radare2. (My work in GSoC'17)
- [Gdbserver implmentation on BitVisor](https://github.com/RKX1209/bitvisor-gdb)  
gdbserver implmentation on Type1 hypervisor using [lwip](https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip/).
You can do remote system debugging on Guest OS from your local machine through lightweight hypervisor.  
- [Kernel Analysis Platform](https://github.com/KernelAnalysisPlatform)  
WIP project. Platform that supports more efficient kernel analysis.
- [TinyLinux](https://github.com/RKX1209/TinyLinux)  
Mini Linux kernel implmentation from scatch
- [Dnscript](https://github.com/RKX1209/Dnscript)  
Scripting language that is specialized in writing "danmaku" of shooting game.
- [C3](https://github.com/RKX1209/c3)  
SMT solver written in C
- K2E  
coming soon...
