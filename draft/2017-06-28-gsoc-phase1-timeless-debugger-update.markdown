GSoC (Google Summer of Code) Phase1 has been finished. This post is to outline the work completed during
the Phase1 period and show you an overview of *radare2 Timeless Debugger*.

# Timeless Debugger
To illustrate the architecture of r2 Timeless Debugger, Firstly I need to explain, *"What is Timeless Debugging?"*.  
Timeless Debugging is a new paradigm of debugging, that is very similar to *"Reverse debugging"* or *"Record and Replay"*.
It observes a binary at any point of its execution state by saving entire execution log.
For example, [QIRA](qira.me) execute every operations, like `mov rax, [0x1000]` by QEMU and
records each logs like, `Write [0x1000] to rax`. After all recordings, user can restore each program states
at any point of binary by using these records.  

# r2 Timeless Debugger
In GSoC term, I'm working on full scratch implmentation of r2 Timeless Debugger.
This section show you an overview of r2 Timeless Debugger and what I have done during the past four weeks.

## Record and Replay
The architecture of r2 Timeless Debugger is fundamentally based on traditional debugging concept, *"Record and Replay (RnR)"*. In RnR, firstly you need to run debuggee process and record *non-deterministic behavior*.
**NOTE: Only "non"deterministic events need to be recorded, because deterministic events can be reproduced by running actual program.** 
After that, you can restore execution state at any point of the program. That's how, traditional RnR functions like, `reverse-next` or `reverse-continue` of gdb are working correctly.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
